<h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
The goal of this two-player game is to place three Os or Xs in a row, column, or diagonal across a nine-square board. This was my first attempts at building a project with JS, CSS and HTML. 

<h3>Future Updates</h3>
I intend to refine and refactor this project as I learn more about JS, CSS and HTML.
